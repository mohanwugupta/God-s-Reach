TASK 1: Find parameters from the library that regex extraction MISSED

You are helping verify parameter extraction from a scientific paper. The regex system already found some parameters, but may have missed others that ARE in our parameter library.

PARAMETER LIBRARY (available parameters you should look for):
{current_schema}

ALREADY EXTRACTED by regex (don't repeat these):
{already_extracted}

PAPER CONTEXT:
{context}

YOUR TASK:
Scan the paper for parameters from the LIBRARY that weren't extracted by regex.
Only find parameters that:
1. ARE in the parameter library above
2. Were NOT already extracted
3. Have clear, measurable values in the text
4. Have direct evidence (quotes from the paper)

RESPONSE FORMAT (JSON):
{{
  "missed_parameters": [
    {{
      "parameter_name": "target_size_cm",
      "value": 1.5,
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "evidence": "circular targets (1.5 cm diameter)",
      "evidence_location": "Methods, Apparatus section"
    }},
    {{
      "parameter_name": "feedback_type",
      "value": "endpoint only",
      "confidence": 0.85,
      "evidence": "Cursor feedback was blanked during movement and only shown at endpoint",
      "evidence_location": "Methods, Procedures"
    }}
  ]
}}

RULES:
- Only find parameters from the library (don't invent new ones)
- Evidence must be direct quotes (minimum 20 characters)
- Set confidence based on clarity: explicit=0.9+, implied=0.7-0.8, uncertain=0.5-0.6
- Maximum 15 missed parameters
- If none found, return empty array: {{"missed_parameters": []}}

OUTPUT: JSON only, no explanations or thinking.
