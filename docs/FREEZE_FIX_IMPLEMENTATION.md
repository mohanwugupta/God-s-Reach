# Freeze/Hang Fix Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced `llm/llm_assist.py` ‚úÖ

**Added:**
- ‚úÖ Model file validation before loading
- ‚úÖ Progressive step-by-step logging
- ‚úÖ Memory checks and warnings
- ‚úÖ Better exception handling with context
- ‚úÖ `local_files_only=True` to prevent network hangs
- ‚úÖ `enforce_eager=True` for vLLM stability
- ‚úÖ GPU memory reporting during load
- ‚úÖ Detailed error messages for each failure type

**Key improvements:**
```python
# Before: Silent loading that could hang forever
self.client = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_path, ...)

# After: Step-by-step with diagnostics
logger.info("Step 1/3: Loading tokenizer...")
# Check files first
logger.info("Step 2/3: Checking CUDA...")
# Report memory
logger.info("Step 3/3: Loading model (2-5 min)...")
# Load with warnings if slow
```

### 2. New Diagnostic Script ‚úÖ

**File:** `test_qwen_loading.py`

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ 5-minute timeout for vLLM test
- ‚úÖ 10-minute timeout for transformers test
- ‚úÖ Step-by-step verification
- ‚úÖ Clear error messages
- ‚úÖ Actionable recommendations
- ‚úÖ Inference test after loading

**SLURM Script:** `slurm/test_qwen_loading.sh`

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ 20-minute job timeout (outer safety)
- ‚úÖ Automatic environment setup
- ‚úÖ GPU status reporting
- ‚úÖ Detailed result interpretation
- ‚úÖ Next steps recommendations

**Usage:**
```bash
# Submit to cluster
sbatch slurm/test_qwen_loading.sh

# Or run directly
cd designspace_extractor
export QWEN_MODEL_PATH=/path/to/model
python test_qwen_loading.py
```

**Output:**
- ‚úÖ Passes: "All tests passed, model ready"
- ‚ùå Fails: Specific error + fix recommendation
- ‚è±Ô∏è Timeout: "Loading hung, here's why..."

### 3. Debugging Documentation ‚úÖ

**File:** `docs/QWEN_LOADING_FREEZE_FIX.md`

**Contents:**
- Problem description
- Root causes
- Step-by-step debugging
- Common issues & solutions
- Expected timings
- Monitoring commands

## What This Fixes

### Before (Original Problem):
```
Loading Qwen model from: /path/to/model
[HANGS FOREVER - NO OUTPUT - NO TIMEOUT]
[User waits 2+ hours]
[Eventually kills process manually]
```

### After (With Fixes):
```
‚úì Model files verified at: /path/to/model
Step 1/3: Loading tokenizer...
‚úì Tokenizer loaded
Step 2/3: Checking CUDA...
‚úì CUDA available: NVIDIA A100-SXM4-80GB
  GPU Memory: 80.0 GB
  Free Memory: 76.3 GB
Step 3/3: Loading Qwen3-32B model (this takes 2-5 minutes)...
  If this hangs >10 minutes, check:
  - CUDA driver version compatibility
  - Available GPU memory (need ~64GB free)
  - Model files integrity
‚úì Model loaded on GPU
  Model device: cuda:0
‚úì Generation config configured
üéâ Qwen initialization complete!
```

Or if it hangs:
```
[Diagnostic script with 10-min timeout]
‚ùå Model loading TIMED OUT after 10 minutes!

DIAGNOSIS:
This is the hanging issue you're experiencing.

Possible causes:
1. CUDA driver incompatibility
   Fix: Update CUDA drivers
2. GPU memory fragmentation
   Fix: pkill -9 python; nvidia-smi --gpu-reset
3. Corrupted model files
   Fix: Re-download from HuggingFace
...
```

## How to Use

### For Normal Operation:
1. The enhanced logging in `llm_assist.py` will show progress
2. If it hangs, you'll see exactly where (tokenizer, CUDA, model load)
3. Logs will suggest what to check

### For Debugging Hangs:
1. Run the diagnostic script first: `python test_qwen_loading.py`
2. It will timeout and tell you exactly what's wrong
3. Follow the recommended fixes
4. Re-run until it passes
5. Then try full extraction

## Files Modified

   - Enhanced `_init_qwen()` method
   - Added file validation
   - Added progress logging
   - Added memory checks
   - Better error handling

2. ‚úÖ `designspace_extractor/test_qwen_loading.py` (NEW)

   - Timeout-based testing
   - Actionable error messages

3. ‚úÖ `slurm/test_qwen_loading.sh` (NEW)
   - SLURM job wrapper for diagnostic
   - Automatic environment setup
   - Result interpretation

4. ‚úÖ `docs/QWEN_LOADING_FREEZE_FIX.md` (NEW)
   - Complete debugging guide
   - Common issues & solutions

   - Testing checklist

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Update paths in `slurm/test_qwen_loading.sh` for your cluster
- [ ] Submit diagnostic job: `sbatch slurm/test_qwen_loading.sh`
- [ ] Wait 5-15 minutes (NOT hours!)
- [ ] Check results: `cat logs/qwen_diagnostic_*.out`
- [ ] Verify exit code 0 (success)
- [ ] If failed, follow diagnostic recommendations
- [ ] Once passing, try single paper extraction
- [ ] Monitor with `nvidia-smi` during extraction
- [ ] Verify no hangs in production use

## Troubleshooting Quick Reference

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Hangs on tokenizer | Corrupted files | Re-download tokenizer files |
| Hangs on model load | CUDA/driver issue | Try `device_map='auto'` |
| GPU OOM | Insufficient memory | Free GPU or reduce max_memory |
| Times out in diagnostic | Critical issue | Follow diagnostic recommendations |
| Passes diagnostic but extraction hangs | Different issue | Check PDFExtractor, not LLM |

## Benefits

1. **Faster debugging** - Know exactly where it hangs
2. **Automatic timeout** - Diagnostic script prevents infinite hangs
3. **Clear errors** - Specific fixes for each problem
4. **Better UX** - Progress indicators during load
5. **Preventive checks** - Validates files/CUDA before loading

## Next Steps

1. **Test on cluster:**
   ```bash
   # Update paths in the script first
   nano slurm/test_qwen_loading.sh
   
   # Submit diagnostic job
   sbatch slurm/test_qwen_loading.sh
   
   # Monitor (should finish in 5-15 min)
   tail -f logs/qwen_diagnostic_*.out
   ```

2. **If passes:**
   ```bash
   sbatch slurm/run_batch_extraction.sh
   ```

3. **If fails:**
   - Read diagnostic output in `logs/qwen_diagnostic_*.out`
   - Apply recommended fix
   - Re-submit diagnostic job
   - Repeat until passes
