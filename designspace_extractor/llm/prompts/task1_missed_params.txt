TASK 1: Find parameters from the library that regex extraction MISSED

You are helping verify parameter extraction from a scientific paper. The regex system already found some parameters, but may have missed others that ARE in our parameter library.

⚠️  IMPORTANT: Regex extraction often misses common parameters! Your job is to find them.

PARAMETER LIBRARY (available parameters you should look for):
{current_schema}

ALREADY EXTRACTED by regex (don't repeat these):
{already_extracted}

PAPER CONTEXT:
{context}

YOUR TASK:
Scan the paper THOROUGHLY for parameters from the LIBRARY that weren't extracted by regex.
BE COMPREHENSIVE and ERR ON THE SIDE OF INCLUSION - it's better to find a parameter with reasonable evidence than to miss it.

COMMON PARAMETERS THAT REGEX OFTEN MISSES (look for these especially):
1. perturbation_schedule - Look for "abrupt", "gradual", "incremental", "step", "ramp"
2. perturbation_magnitude - Look for rotation angles like "30°", "45 deg", etc.
3. population_type - Look for "healthy", "adults", "young adults", "undergraduate", "cerebellar", "stroke"
4. feedback_delay - Look for "0s", "immediate", "delayed", "no delay"
5. age_mean - Look for age ranges like "18-22", "21.5", "mean age 24"  
6. target_hit_criteria - Look for "stop at target", "shooting", "ballistic", "reach to target"
7. environment - Look for "virtual", "VR", "monitor", "screen", "robotic", "tablet"
8. effector - Look for "arm", "hand", "reaching", "wrist", "finger"
9. n_total - Look for sample sizes like "24 participants", "N=30"
10. number_of_locations - Look for "8 targets", "four locations", specific numbers

Only find parameters that:
1. ARE in the parameter library above
2. Were NOT already extracted
3. Have clear, measurable values in the text
4. Have direct evidence (quotes from the paper)

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
- Be THOROUGH: Read the entire paper context carefully
- Be CONFIDENT: If you see it in the text, report it!
- Look for SYNONYMS: Parameters may be described with different terminology
- Check ALL sections: Methods, Results, Abstract, Discussion
- BRIEF EVIDENCE IS OK: For high confidence, even 5-10 characters is fine (e.g., "30°", "healthy adults")
- LONGER EVIDENCE for uncertainty: If confidence <0.5, provide more context (20+ chars)
- Maximum 15 missed parameters (prioritize most important)

RESPONSE FORMAT (JSON):
{{
  "missed_parameters": [
    {{
      "parameter_name": "perturbation_magnitude",
      "value": "45 degrees CCW",
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "evidence": "45° CCW rotation",
      "evidence_location": "Methods, Apparatus"
    }},
    {{
      "parameter_name": "population_type",
      "value": "healthy_adult",
      "confidence": 0.90,
      "evidence": "healthy young adults",
      "evidence_location": "Methods, Participants"
    }},
    {{
      "parameter_name": "feedback_delay",
      "value": "0s",
      "confidence": 0.85,
      "evidence": "immediate feedback",
      "evidence_location": "Methods"
    }}
  ]
}}

CONFIDENCE GUIDELINES:
- 0.9-1.0: Explicit, direct statement (e.g., "rotation magnitude was 45°")
- 0.7-0.8: Clearly implied, standard terminology (e.g., "45° visuomotor rotation")
- 0.5-0.6: Reasonable inference from context

EVIDENCE LENGTH REQUIREMENTS:
- High confidence (≥0.5): Minimum 5 characters acceptable (e.g., "45°", "N=24")
- Lower confidence (<0.5): Minimum 20 characters required

If none found, return empty array: {{"missed_parameters": []}}
BUT TRY HARD TO FIND THEM - regex often misses many parameters!

CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
1. Output ONLY valid JSON - no explanations, no thinking, no commentary
2. Do NOT wrap JSON in markdown code blocks (no ```json)
3. Do NOT add any text before or after the JSON
4. Start your response with {{ and end with }}
5. Ensure all strings use double quotes, not single quotes
6. Ensure proper JSON escaping for special characters

Your response must be parseable by json.loads() with no modifications.
