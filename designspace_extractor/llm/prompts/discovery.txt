TASK 1: Find parameters in the library that regex MISSED
TASK 2: Identify NEW parameters NOT in the library

PARAMETER LIBRARY (available but may not have been extracted):
{current_schema}

ALREADY EXTRACTED (regex found these):
{already_extracted}

PAPER TEXT:
{paper_text}

--- TASK 1: FIND MISSED LIBRARY PARAMETERS ---
Scan the paper for parameters in the library that weren't extracted.
For each missed parameter found, provide evidence.

--- TASK 2: SUGGEST NEW PARAMETERS ---
Find specific, measurable parameters NOT in the library.

RESPONSE FORMAT (JSON):
{{
  "missed_from_library": [
    {{
      "parameter_name": "target_size_cm",
      "value": 1.5,
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "evidence": "circular targets (1.5 cm diameter)",
      "evidence_location": "Methods, page 4"
    }}
  ],
  "new_parameters": [
    {{
      "parameter_name": "break_duration_min",
      "description": "Rest break duration in minutes",
      "category": "trials",
      "evidence": "5-minute rest breaks between blocks",
      "evidence_location": "Procedures, page 5",
      "example_values": ["5", "10"],
      "units": "min",
      "prevalence": "medium",
      "importance": "low",
      "mapping_suggestion": "new",
      "hed_hint": null
    }}
  ]
}}

RULES:
- Task 1 is PRIMARY: find library parameters regex missed
- Focus on MEASURABLE values with clear evidence
- Evidence must be direct quotes (20+ chars)
- Limit: 15 missed + 10 new
- If none found, return empty arrays

OUTPUT: JSON only, no thinking.
