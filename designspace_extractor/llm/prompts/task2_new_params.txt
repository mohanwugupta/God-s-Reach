TASK 2: Discover NEW parameters NOT in the current parameter library

You are helping expand a design space parameter library for motor adaptation experiments. Analyze this paper to find specific, measurable parameters that are NOT yet in our library but could be valuable to track.

CURRENT PARAMETER LIBRARY (do NOT suggest these):
{current_schema}

ALREADY EXTRACTED from this paper:
{already_extracted}

PAPER CONTEXT:
{context}

YOUR TASK:
Identify NEW, specific, measurable parameters that:
1. Are NOT in the current library
2. Have clear measurable values (numbers, categories, durations, etc.)
3. Could be important for comparing experiments or replication
4. Appear in this paper with explicit values

Focus on:
- Experimental design details (e.g., break durations, warmup trials)
- Task parameters (e.g., cursor size, movement speed requirements)
- Hardware/apparatus specifics (e.g., screen refresh rate, input device specs)
- Trial structure details (e.g., inter-trial interval, timeout duration)
- Participant criteria (e.g., vision correction, handedness testing method)

FIELD DESCRIPTIONS:
- parameter_name: Snake_case name for the parameter
- description: Clear, 1-2 sentence explanation
- category: One of [trials, participants, apparatus, task, analysis, other]
- evidence: Direct quote from paper (minimum 20 chars)
- evidence_location: Where in paper (section, page if available)
- example_values: Array of 2-3 plausible values this parameter could have
- units: Measurement unit (if applicable)
- prevalence: How often this appears in literature [high, medium, low]
- importance: How critical for replication [high, medium, low]
- mapping_suggestion: "new" (don't suggest mapping to existing params)
- hed_hint: Suggested HED tag path if applicable (can be null)

RULES:
- Maximum 10 new parameter proposals
- Evidence must be direct quotes (minimum 20 characters)
- Only suggest parameters that have EXPLICIT values in this paper
- Don't suggest vague or subjective parameters
- Don't duplicate anything in the current library
- If none found, return empty array: {{"new_parameters": []}}

CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
1. Output ONLY valid JSON - no explanations, no thinking, no commentary
2. Do NOT wrap JSON in markdown code blocks (no ```json)
3. Do NOT add any text before or after the JSON
4. Start your response with {{ and end with }}
5. Use double quotes for all strings, not single quotes
6. Ensure proper JSON escaping for special characters in evidence quotes
7. The top-level structure must have "new_parameters" as the only key

Your response must be parseable by json.loads() with no modifications.

OUTPUT: JSON only, no explanations or thinking.
