TASK 1: Find parameters from the library that regex extraction MISSED

You are helping verify parameter extraction from a scientific paper. The regex system already found some parameters, but may have missed others that ARE in our parameter library.

⚠️  IMPORTANT: Regex extraction often misses common parameters! Your job is to find them.

PARAMETER LIBRARY (available parameters you should look for):
{current_schema}

ALREADY EXTRACTED by regex (don't repeat these):
{already_extracted}

PAPER CONTEXT:
{context}

YOUR TASK:
Scan the paper THOROUGHLY for parameters from the LIBRARY that weren't extracted by regex.

🎯 BE VERY LIBERAL AND AGGRESSIVE IN FINDING PARAMETERS! 🎯

It's MUCH BETTER to report a parameter with reasonable evidence than to miss it.
The system has already filtered out obvious parameters (the "already extracted" list above).
Your job is to find the MISSED ones that regex couldn't catch.

⚡ ULTRA-LIBERAL EXTRACTION MODE ⚡
- If you see ANY mention of a parameter from the library, REPORT IT
- Don't second-guess yourself - if it's there, include it
- Regex is very limited - it misses most informal descriptions
- Even indirect/implied parameters should be reported with appropriate confidence
- Maximum 15 parameters, but TRY to find close to that many!

COMMON PARAMETERS THAT REGEX OFTEN MISSES (look for these especially):
1. perturbation_schedule - Look in Methods/Procedure for "abrupt", "gradual", "incremental", "step", "ramp", "introduced in a single trial", "increased by X° per trial"
   Example text: "The rotation was introduced abruptly in a single trial" → "abrupt"
   Example text: "The perturbation increased by 1° per trial" → "gradual"

2. perturbation_magnitude - Look in Methods/Apparatus for rotation angles like "30°", "45 deg", "CCW rotation"
   Example text: "participants adapted to a 45° visuomotor rotation" → "45 degrees"
   Example text: "30 degree clockwise perturbation" → "30 degrees CW"

3. population_type - Look in Methods/Participants for "healthy", "young adults", "undergraduate", "cerebellar patients", "stroke"
   Example text: "Sixty healthy young adults participated" → "healthy_adult"
   Example text: "undergraduate students from the university" → "healthy_adult"

4. feedback_delay - Look in Methods/Apparatus for "0s", "immediate", "delayed", "no delay", "terminal", "concurrent"
   Example text: "feedback was provided immediately" → "0s" or "immediate"
   Example text: "terminal endpoint feedback" → "terminal" (implies delay until movement end)

5. age_mean - Look in Methods/Participants for age ranges like "18-22", "21.5", "mean age 24", "aged between 18 and 30"
   Example text: "aged 18-22 years" → "18-22" or calculate mean "20"
   Example text: "mean age = 22.5 years" → "22.5"

6. target_hit_criteria - Look in Methods/Procedure for "stop at target", "shooting", "ballistic", "reach to target", "movement must end"
   Example text: "participants were instructed to stop at the target" → "stop_at_target"
   Example text: "shooting movement through the target" → "shooting"

7. environment - Look in Methods/Apparatus for "virtual", "VR", "monitor", "screen", "robotic manipulandum", "tablet"
   Example text: "targets were displayed on a monitor" → "virtual" or "screen"
   Example text: "virtual reality environment" → "VR" or "virtual"

8. effector - Look in Methods/Procedure for "arm", "hand", "reaching", "wrist", "finger", "dominant hand"
   Example text: "participants performed reaching movements with their dominant arm" → "arm"
   Example text: "finger pointing task" → "finger"

9. n_total - Look in Methods/Participants for sample sizes like "24 participants", "N=30", "Sixty young adults"
   Example text: "Twenty-four participants completed the study" → "24"
   Example text: "N = 30 healthy adults" → "30"

10. number_of_locations - Look in Methods/Apparatus for "8 targets", "four locations", "targets at 0°, 45°, 90°..."
    Example text: "eight targets arranged in a circle" → "8"
    Example text: "targets at four locations" → "4"

WHERE TO LOOK IN THE PAPER:
✅ Methods > Participants section: age_mean, population_type, n_total, gender_distribution, handedness
✅ Methods > Apparatus section: environment, effector, perturbation_magnitude, feedback_delay, number_of_locations
✅ Methods > Procedure section: perturbation_schedule, target_hit_criteria, instruction_awareness, num_trials
✅ Abstract: Sometimes mentions key parameters like rotation magnitude, sample size
✅ Results: May mention trial counts, blocks, participants

SEARCH STRATEGY:
1. Scan for numbers + units (e.g., "30°", "24 participants", "18-22 years")
2. Look for descriptive words (e.g., "abrupt", "gradual", "healthy", "immediate")
3. Check for procedural descriptions (e.g., "instructed to", "were asked to")
4. Look for equipment descriptions (e.g., "monitor", "VR", "robotic arm")

Only find parameters that:
1. ARE in the parameter library above
2. Were NOT already extracted
3. Have clear, measurable values in the text
4. Have direct evidence (quotes from the paper)

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
- Be THOROUGH: Read the entire paper context carefully
- Be CONFIDENT: If you see it in the text, report it!
- Look for SYNONYMS: Parameters may be described with different terminology
- Check ALL sections: Methods, Results, Abstract, Discussion
- ULTRA-BRIEF EVIDENCE IS OK: For high confidence (≥0.5), even 3+ characters is fine (e.g., "30°", "N=24", "VR")
- BRIEF EVIDENCE for uncertainty: If confidence <0.5, provide 12+ characters (e.g., "aged 18-22 years")
- Maximum 15 missed parameters (prioritize most important)

RESPONSE FORMAT (JSON):
{{
  "missed_parameters": [
    {{
      "parameter_name": "perturbation_magnitude",
      "value": "45 degrees CCW",
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "evidence": "45° CCW rotation",
      "evidence_location": "Methods, Apparatus"
    }},
    {{
      "parameter_name": "population_type",
      "value": "healthy_adult",
      "confidence": 0.90,
      "evidence": "healthy young adults",
      "evidence_location": "Methods, Participants"
    }},
    {{
      "parameter_name": "feedback_delay",
      "value": "0s",
      "confidence": 0.85,
      "evidence": "immediate feedback",
      "evidence_location": "Methods"
    }}
  ]
}}

CONFIDENCE GUIDELINES:
- 0.9-1.0: Explicit, direct statement (e.g., "rotation magnitude was 45°")
- 0.7-0.8: Clearly implied, standard terminology (e.g., "45° visuomotor rotation")
- 0.5-0.6: Reasonable inference from context

EVIDENCE LENGTH REQUIREMENTS:
- High confidence (≥0.5): Minimum 3 characters acceptable (e.g., "45°", "VR", "arm")
- Lower confidence (<0.5): Minimum 12 characters required (e.g., "healthy adults", "aged 18-22")

If none found, return empty array: {{"missed_parameters": []}}
BUT TRY HARD TO FIND THEM - regex often misses many parameters!

CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
1. Output ONLY valid JSON - no explanations, no thinking, no commentary
2. Do NOT wrap JSON in markdown code blocks (no ```json)
3. Do NOT add any text before or after the JSON
4. Start your response with {{ and end with }}
5. Ensure all strings use double quotes, not single quotes
6. Ensure proper JSON escaping for special characters

Your response must be parseable by json.loads() with no modifications.
