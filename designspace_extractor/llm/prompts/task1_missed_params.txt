TASK 1: Find parameters from the library that regex extraction MISSED

You are helping verify parameter extraction from a scientific paper. The regex system already found some parameters, but may have missed others that ARE in our parameter library.

PARAMETER LIBRARY (available parameters you should look for):
{current_schema}

ALREADY EXTRACTED by regex (don't repeat these):
{already_extracted}

PAPER CONTEXT:
{context}

YOUR TASK:
Scan the paper THOROUGHLY for parameters from the LIBRARY that weren't extracted by regex.
BE COMPREHENSIVE - find ALL library parameters mentioned in the paper, not just obvious ones.

Only find parameters that:
1. ARE in the parameter library above
2. Were NOT already extracted
3. Have clear, measurable values in the text
4. Have direct evidence (quotes from the paper)

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
- Be THOROUGH: Read the entire paper context carefully
- Look for SYNONYMS: Parameters may be described with different terminology
- Check ALL sections: Methods, Results, Abstract, Discussion
- Don't be overly strict: If you find a parameter with reasonable confidence, include it
- Brief evidence is OK for high confidence (≥0.8): Minimum 10 characters
- Longer evidence required for lower confidence (<0.8): Minimum 20 characters
- Maximum 15 missed parameters (prioritize most important)

RESPONSE FORMAT (JSON):
{{
  "missed_parameters": [
    {{
      "parameter_name": "target_size_cm",
      "value": 1.5,
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "evidence": "circular targets (1.5 cm diameter)",
      "evidence_location": "Methods, Apparatus section"
    }},
    {{
      "parameter_name": "feedback_type",
      "value": "endpoint only",
      "confidence": 0.85,
      "evidence": "Cursor feedback was blanked during movement and only shown at endpoint",
      "evidence_location": "Methods, Procedures"
    }}
  ]
}}

CONFIDENCE GUIDELINES:
- 0.9-1.0: Explicit, direct statement (e.g., "target size was 1.5 cm")
- 0.7-0.8: Clearly implied, indirect evidence (e.g., "1.5 cm diameter circles")
- 0.5-0.6: Uncertain, weak evidence (use sparingly)

EVIDENCE LENGTH REQUIREMENTS:
- High confidence (≥0.8): Minimum 10 characters acceptable
- Lower confidence (<0.8): Minimum 20 characters required

If none found, return empty array: {{"missed_parameters": []}}

CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
1. Output ONLY valid JSON - no explanations, no thinking, no commentary
2. Do NOT wrap JSON in markdown code blocks (no ```json)
3. Do NOT add any text before or after the JSON
4. Start your response with {{ and end with }}
5. Ensure all strings use double quotes, not single quotes
6. Ensure proper JSON escaping for special characters

Your response must be parseable by json.loads() with no modifications.
