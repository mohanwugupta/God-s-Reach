TASK: Quick verification of extracted parameters. Only provide reasoning if there's a discrepancy.

EXTRACTED PARAMETERS TO VERIFY:
${extracted_params}

STUDY CONTEXT:
Study Type: ${study_type}
Experiments: ${num_experiments}

${context}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. For each parameter: scan context, verify value is correct
2. If value matches context → set "verified": true, provide concise evidence
3. If value is WRONG → provide correct value + brief reasoning + concise evidence
4. If parameter NOT in context → set "abstained": true
5. Keep responses CONCISE - no explanations unless correcting an error

OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON):
{{
  "parameter_name": {{
    "verified": true,  // If extracted value is correct
    "value": <value>,  // Only include if correcting or adding
    "confidence": 0.9,
    "evidence": "concise quote or description supporting the value",  // ALWAYS required
    "reasoning": "brief",  // ONLY if discrepancy exists
    "abstained": false
  }}
}}

EXAMPLE (mostly correct):
{{
  "sample_size_n": {{
    "verified": true,
    "evidence": "20 participants were recruited"
  }},
  "rotation_magnitude_deg": {{
    "verified": false,
    "value": 30,
    "confidence": 0.95,
    "evidence": "visuomotor rotation of 30° was applied",
    "reasoning": "Extracted said 45° but paper states 30°"
  }},
  "target_size_cm": {{"abstained": true}}
}}

CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
1. Output ONLY valid JSON - no explanations, no thinking, no commentary
2. Do NOT wrap JSON in markdown code blocks (no ```json)
3. Do NOT add any text before or after the JSON
4. Start your response with {{ and end with }}
5. Use double quotes for all strings, not single quotes
6. Ensure proper JSON escaping for special characters
7. The top-level structure must be a dictionary with parameter names as keys

Your response must be parseable by json.loads() with no modifications.
